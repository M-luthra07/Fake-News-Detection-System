# Deep-Learning-Project(Fake News Detection System)
Overview
This project implements a hybrid deep learning model for fake news detection using BERT embeddings, LSTM networks, and SVM classification. The system analyzes news headlines to classify them as "real" or "fake".

Key Features
BERT Tokenization: Uses pre-trained BERT embeddings for text representation

LSTM Model: Bidirectional LSTM architecture for sequence processing

SVM Classifier: Uses features extracted from the LSTM layer

Hybrid Approach: Combines LSTM and SVM predictions with additional rules

Performance Metrics: Evaluates accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

Results
The model achieves:

LSTM: 89.80% accuracy

SVM: 91.51% accuracy

Hybrid: 91.48% accuracy
